title: Only If He Could Die
---

<p>
The world is full of stories. In any time or place everyone is a part of their own tales. But some stories become so eternal that they are remembered even after their time passes away.
But this story is not of this time or even this world. There was a world beyond this time and land. A world so similar to our own, yet so different. 
In my opinion that world was more special than our own. The lands of that world were not only habitated by mankind but by many more intelligent species.
Some of those species like fairies, giants , dwarves were like out of some bed time stories. But some of them were no more than a nightmare.

But this story is not about the races or that world in particular. This story is two beings who might have been each others entire world. This is a story about love.

This story starts with a man , lowly in his birth, ways and life. Time and hardship has always a very strange impact on our minds. Sometimes it tends to make us and sometimes we become so brittle that it breaks us. So was the case with him. 
Being played by time and life he became a Marauder or as we will call him Mar.

As Mar he was the best in his line of work. There came a time in his life where there was nothing that was out of the clutches of his hand, quite literally. He was known for his 100 percent success rate. People and beings from all over hired him for nearly impossible feats of theft.
He quite frankly became unstoppable and bored. Yes he was bored.

As reality had less challenges to offer he turned towards the legends and myths of his world. Searching for something that could interest him he came across a legend. A legend so invigorating and reward so precious that Mar could not hold back his excitement.

The legend was about a deep jungle in a far off land. In admist of that jungle was a hill shrouded by flora and fauna as if being protected by it. That jungle was better known to most as the land of fairies or the jungle of fairies. Well as many names as there are mouths. 
Nonetheless the legend was that the hill in between of that jungle hid the secret to most highly sought reward by any man in any world, immortality. The hill was supposedly home to a fountain of youth. But some said that it was guarded by the most vicious and deadly of the fairies. A fairy so frightful that any being has not returned alive even after having a glimpse of that fairy.

But Mar was excited. Also as he had not failed in a very very long time, he had an extra ordinary amount of belief in his skills.

Mar soon started his journey towards this new adrenaline filled adventure. 

In a few days he found himself in the line of sight of the legendary jungle. It was as if the exitement would burst of his very being.
Mar stood at a cliff that overlooked that jungle from a distance.  The jungle was densly packed with trees and various plant life that Mar had never seen in his life. The secnary of the hill in between the jungle was almost mesemerising from a distance. It was as if the whole jungle bowed down to the throne that was the immortality granting hill. He could see the top of the canopy of the jungle. Even though bundled togather there were circles of so many colorful leafed trees standing tall between him and his goal.

Without wasting a moment Mar rushed down the hill towards the edge of the jungle. As he entered the densely packed jungle it became darker even in the middle of the day. The canopy above blocked almost all light from the sun. Only portions of light came from between the silhouettes of canopy. As he went deeper he could see the flowers that shone fluorescent. Even the butterflies had a silver or golden tint to their wings. It was so beautiful that Mer forgot about his adventure for a while to appreciated and astonish at the beauty of the land. 

Now moving even deeper into the jungle he spotted some really preculiar winged kid like beings. They resembled tiny stuffed dolls from our world but with wings. Mar knew they posed no threat to him so he moved forward. It took some time but Mar had finally managed to reach the foot of the hill. The climb was really steep almost perpendicular. No ordinary man would even dare to climb that hill. But Mar was no ordinary man. 

He started his climb up the hill. While his ascent something wierd or even supernatural happened. The canopy shifted once or twice to break Mar's fall to the ground when he lost his balance. Jilting this happening as luck he continued his climb. Soon he was up top. By the time Mar had finished his climb it was already dark even above the canopy.

The first view after his climb was something so magnificent and magnanimous in itself that even a blind man would cry at the beauty of the creation.
Under the dark night sky there was a tree with his gianormous roots going deep in the hill. The tree bore fruits that twinkled like golden fruits. A small stream of water poured out of the trunk of the tree. That stream fed to a very small pond in the middle of the hill. It was in that pond a silver fountain of that water sparkled in the moonlight. 

Mar did not take much time to understand that he was witnessing the fountain of immortality. He paced towards the fountain to drink as a mortal man for one last time. But his heed pace was broken as now a thick branch had caught his leg and had crawled up his body to tangle around his neck. At that very moment he felt his skin crawl. He knew that it was the vicious spirit everyone warned him about. For few moments he was even afraid to open his eyes as the branch of the tree tightened around his neck.
But as he slowly opened his expectation subverted when he saw an attractive looking maiden girl of rather average height levitating infront of her. Her gaze was fixed on the tangled and trapped Mar as if scrutinizing something rare.
Mar could just laugh at the beautiful sight of the vicious fairly that doomed every visitor to the jingle. That laugh changed the curious gaze of the fairy into a wry face like that of a kid. In an instant Mar's laughter stopped as he felt the branch even tighter around her neck. He started to loose consciousness as the fairy's expression changed to a grin.

After a while as Mar gained consciousness he saw small stuff doll like fairies floating above his head observing him. As Mar got startled , the fairies also scattered. 

"Why did the Fairy Forest try to save you? It even tried to help you reach here. Why?", said the fairy while levitating in a thinking pose.(her hand on her chin as she gazed at the sky)
As Mar stood up he saw the fairy busy in her own thoughts. Seeking the opportunity he rushed towards the fountain. He found himself in a tangle of branches.

"Don't even try." said the fairy without even breaking her pose in mid air.

"You all humans are just selfish. For your own selfish motives you are ready to kill the entire forest. Do you even know that if you drink even a sip from the  fountain the entire forest will die?" said the fairy as she leaned over trapped Mar.

Hearing this Mar's eyes widened in shock. "I am sorry", said Mar as he realised the truth behind the fountain of immortality.
Not believing him the fairy used her fairy powers to read his mind. She could feel his emotions regarding the beauty of the view and scenery the forest offered Mar.
"What will I even do with this immortality, if I think about it?. I am already bored of most things in life." said Mar.

Understanding his mind the fairy loosened her grip around Mar.

"My name is Elina." said the fairy as she gave a hand to Mar to help him get up.

From that point Mar just stayed for a couple of years in that Forest just for the view and delicious fruits(that is what Mar said to Elina).
Elina's curiosity grew into something else in that course of time. They both grew closer, but never said anything.

But life is the curve that comes down when it has gone too high.

Apart from beautiful forest filled with fairies their world also had some horror worse than any nightmare.

One dawn the sky above the forest turned red as the fire rained over it. Elina and Mar were quick to realise that something really bad was about to happen. As they went till the egde of the mountain they could see demonic beings raining fire over them. As Elina used the canopy of the forest to save Mar from that fiery hailstorm, she got blind sided and was injured by one of the fireballs.

Having stolen many invaluable things in past Mar never valued anything more than Elina. She was the only part of the entire creation that he ever earned.

As he rushed by her side he realised that Elina was mortally wounded. Without a second thought he carried her towards the fountain as that was the only thing that could save her. But his efforts were cut short by the another fireball. Now the demonic figures were approaching closer. Burnt and wounded he was still dragging himself towards Elina.
Somehow Mar drew some water from the pond and was able to pour that water in Elina's mouth from a leaf.
Doing that he fell to the ground. He closed his eyes with satisfaction for the first time in a very long time.
As he was about to let himself go in eternal slumber he felt lips on his lips kissing him. 

It was Elina. As they kissed Elina poured the entire water back into Mar's mouth. 
It was their first and the last kiss.

It is said that Marauder has been roaming his world for centuries to get back his love.
But that could happen ONLY IF HE COULD DIE...
